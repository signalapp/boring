# Low-level bindings to BoringSSL

[BoringSSL](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl) is Google's fork of OpenSSL for Chrome/Chromium and Android.

This crate builds the BoringSSL library (or optionally links a pre-built version) and generates FFI bindings for it.
It supports [FIPS-compatible builds of BoringSSL](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/+/master/crypto/fipsmodule/FIPS.md),
as well as [Post-Quantum crypto](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-ecdhe-mlkem/)
and [Raw Public Key](https://docs.rs/boring/latest/boring/ssl/struct.SslRef.html#method.peer_pubkey) extensions.

To use BoringSSL from Rust, prefer the [higher-level safe API](https://docs.rs/boring).
